Surface electromyography based motion recognition (sEMG-PR) is considered as a promising control method for various human-machine interaction systems. Since sEMG signals are user-dependent and are affected by a number of factors such as the quantity of subcutaneous fat skin impedance, the sEMG-PR performance would be degraded the performance of sEMG-PR for different users. In order to solve this issue, a novel unsupervised cross-individual motion recognition method was proposed in this study. In the proposed method, the sEMG features from different individuals are mapped to a same subspace by self-adjusting dimensional dynamic distribution adaptation (SD-DDA), in which both of the marginal and conditional distributions of source and target features are aligned in the subspace by automatically selected the optimal feature domain dimension of unlabeled target data. Different feature sets were used to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. And our results showed that the average classification accuracy was improved by above 10% for different subjects. Additionally, compared to the commonly used domain adaptation algorithms, the proposed method could increase the classification accuracies of different feature sets at least 3.5%. These results suggested that the proposed SD-DDA method would be feasible for cross-individual motion intention recognition, which would provide help for the application of sEMG-PR based system.
